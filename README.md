> A useful collection of resources for creating apps with [Ractive.js](http://www.ractivejs.org/)

This is a curated list of useful stuff based around Ractive.js.  I found that there was very little that I could easily find, so I'm hoping to collect as much as possible here (that is clear & easy to read understand)

## Components-Decorators-Plugins-for-Ractive 

###### With an online live demo

- [Ractive-decorators-sortable](http://ractivejs.github.io/Ractive-decorators-sortable/) - a sortable decorator to Ractive, which enables elements that correspond to array members to be re-ordered using the HTML5 drag and drop API. Doing so will update the order of the array.
- [ractive-dropdown](http://alexserver.github.io/ractive-dropdown/demo/) - Github repo link is [here](https://github.com/alexserver/ractive-dropdown) - A Dropdown list component for Ractive.js.
- [ractive-tooltip](http://jondum.github.io/ractive-tooltip/demo/) - Github repo link is [here](https://github.com/JonDum/ractive-tooltip) - A tooltip for active
- [Bootstrap plugin for Ractive.js](http://dagnelies.github.io/ractive-bootstrap/) - This Ractive plugin provides helper shortcuts for most bootstrap widgets.  The goal of this plugin is to help you get started quickly and reduce the overly verbose code that bootstrap tends to produce. It does not attempt to cover everything in bootstrap, but rather offer the most common elements as shortcuts. Sometimes, when you want something more specific or fancy, you can still use the original bootstrap markup.
